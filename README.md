Hello, this is the core practices for Git.

You will learn many ways to operate git through commands such as git clone, git commit, git push, git pull, etc.

Git commands are very useful and important to lear while coding, but you do not have to memorize them right away! The more you use git commands the quicker you will memorize the commands through sheer repitition. Just think in probably a few months or even weeks you can do git commands without even having to reference a git cheatsheet, imagine that!

For now, you can use Google to follow cheatsheets until you get the hang of it.

Happy coding!
